Hi, I'm a software engineer currently focused on designing and building out a RESTful service architecture for a Chicago-area company.

I have extensive experience with Python, Django and RESTful design. I've open sourced some of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">my work</a>, which is used widely in the Django ecosystem. On the front end, I have designed and built a number of large-scale, complex Angular applications.

In addition to my open-source work, I have some availability on a consultancy basis for development and design. If you would like to discuss collaborating, please <a href="mailto:robertgsinger@gmail.com">get in touch</a>. I enjoy building elegant solutions to complex problems and iterating as new opportunities emerge.
